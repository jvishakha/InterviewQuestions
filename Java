1. Difference between Wrapper classes and Primitive Data Types.
2. How does main() method execution works?
3. Can we change the access modifier for an overridden method in subclass? For e.g. can a public method of super class be made protected in sub class?

5. class Abc{
  {
  block statement;
  }
  
  //constructor
  Abc(){
  }
  
  //static block
  
  static{
  }
  
  p.s.v.m(){
  Abc abc = new Abc;
  }
}

When an instance of above class is created what would be the execution flow of block, static block, constructor?
What wold be the flow when second instance is created?

6. Can a class be static?
7. Exception Handling - 
  class Parent{
    show() throws IOException{}
  }
  class SubClass extends Parent{
